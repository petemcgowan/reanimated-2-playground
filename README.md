# reanimated-2-playground

This repo contains a fresh React Native project with preinstalled Reanimated V2

Config for Reanimated can be a little tricky, not a bad idea to start with a configured project. This even needed changes from the software mansion version.

Don't forget to install dependencies:

```bash
cd reanimated-2-playground && yarn
```

If you want to install app on the iOS simulator:

```bash
npx pod-install
```

Then run the app using Xcode or `react-native` CLI.
